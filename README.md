This project simulates various scheduling strategies within a discrete event simulation framework, primarily event-driven programming. 
The goal is to implement and manage the scheduling behavior of job arrivals and completions. 
Job arrivals, completions, and preemption are handled by developing linked list structures and specific scheduling strategies. 
The code efficiently manages the job queue and calculates the completion time of the next job. 
It is critical to schedule and cancel and restart jobs correctly, and understanding the nuances of event time and job ordering is key to creating a functional and correct simulation.
